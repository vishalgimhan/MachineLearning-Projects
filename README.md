# MachineLearningProjects

**1. Waiter Tip Prediction Model**

- **Data Overview**: It includes an initial examination of the waiter tips dataset, showcasing the first few entries and the structure of the data.

- **Data Visualization**: The project presents various scatter plots and pie charts to analyze the relationship between total bill, tips, and other variables like day, sex, time, and smoker status.

- **Data Transformation**: Categorical variables such as sex, smoker, day, and time are transformed into numerical values for further analysis.

- **Model Building**: A Linear Regression model is constructed using features like total bill, sex, smoker, day, time, and size to predict the tip amount.

- **Model Evaluation**: The modelâ€™s performance is assessed using the mean squared error metric.

- **Application Development**: A simple application is built to predict the tip amount based on user input for different features.

**2. Machine Learning Course - Kaggle**

- **Data Exploration**: Utilizing pandas to explore and manipulate the Melbourne home prices dataset.

- **First Machine Learning Model**: Selecting features, defining, fitting, predicting, and evaluating a Decision Tree model.

- **Model Validation**: Splitting data into training and validation sets to measure model accuracy using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

- **Underfitting and Overfitting**: Addressing model performance issues by adjusting the complexity of the Decision Tree model.

- **Random Forest**: Introducing the Random Forest model as a means to improve predictions by averaging multiple decision trees.
