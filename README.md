# Machine Learning Projects

**1. Waiter Tip Prediction Model**

- **Data Overview**: It includes an initial examination of the waiter tips dataset, showcasing the first few entries and the structure of the data.

- **Data Visualization**: The project presents various scatter plots and pie charts to analyze the relationship between total bill, tips, and other variables like day, sex, time, and smoker status.

- **Data Transformation**: Categorical variables such as sex, smoker, day, and time are transformed into numerical values for further analysis.

- **Model Building**: A Linear Regression model is constructed using features like total bill, sex, smoker, day, time, and size to predict the tip amount.

- **Model Evaluation**: The modelâ€™s performance is assessed using the mean squared error metric.

- **Application Development**: A simple application is built to predict the tip amount based on user input for different features.

**2. Future Sales Prediction Model**

- **Data Loading**: It involves importing libraries and loading a dataset from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Checking for null values in the dataset to ensure data quality.

- **Data Visualization**: Creating scatter plots to visualize relationships between sales and advertising costs using Plotly.

- **Correlation Analysis**: Calculating the correlation between sales and advertising costs to determine the impact of TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising.

- **Model Training**: Splitting the data into training and test sets, and training a Linear Regression model to predict future sales.

- **Prediction Function**: Implementing a function to predict sales based on user input for TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising costs.
